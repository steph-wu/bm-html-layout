      <h1>The Imbalance of Culture Fit</h1>
      <h3>by Matt Griffin · 9 Comments</h3>
    </header>
    <p>Part of getting to a better place in the new year is recognizing where we
      have sway, and going past our own discomfort to create positive change in
      ourselves and in the world. Those of us who have a role in the hiring process
      can do better by thinking critically about culture fit. Matt Griffin challenges
      us to consider whether it actually creates the kind of team that’s the best
      for the enterprise, or mostly serves to make us comfortable by surrounding
      us with people largely like ourselves in ways that aren’t relevant to the business.</p>
